My name is Daniel Murfet, I am a Lecturer (aka tenure-track Assistant Professor) in the [Mathematics Department](http://www.ms.unimelb.edu.au/) at the University of Melbourne and part of the [logic group](http://blogs.unimelb.edu.au/logic/). My CV is [here](http://therisingsea.org/cv.pdf) and you can contact me by [email](mailto:d.murfet@unimelb.edu.au) or find me [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/danielmurfet). My papers are [on the arXiv](http://arxiv.org/find/math/1/au:+Murfet_D/0/1/0/all/0/1) with the exception of my PhD thesis which you can find [here](http://therisingsea.org/thesis.pdf). My primary research interests are in algebraic geometry, category theory and mathematical logic. You can see some of the things I like to think about in my [Spring 2013 article in Emissary](https://www.msri.org/attachments/media/news/emissary/EmissarySpring2013.pdf) on matrix factorisations and my [survey of linear logic](http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.2650). I currently run two seminars: one on the [Curry-Howard correspondence](http://therisingsea.org/post/seminar-ch/) and another on [topological field theory](http://therisingsea.org/post/seminar-tft/). I have various code projects [on GitHub](https://github.com/dmurfet/) including my joint project with Nils Carqueville on [computing with matrix factorisations](https://github.com/dmurfet/mf), and my joint project with Huiyi Hu on [linear logic and deep learning](https://github.com/dmurfet/polysemantics).

The title of this webpage refers to the following quote from Grothendieck, which I learned from Colin McLarty's [article](http://www.cwru.edu/artsci/phil/RisingSea.pdf) "The Rising Sea: Grothendieck on Simplicity and Generality"

> A different image came to me a few weeks ago. The unknown thing to be known appeared to me as some stretch of earth or hard marl, resisting penetration ... the sea advances insensibly in silence, nothing seems to happen, nothing moves, the water is so far off you hardly hear it ... yet it finally surrounds the resistant substance.
