My name is Daniel Murfet, I am a Lecturer (aka tenure-track Assistant Professor) in the [Mathematics Department](http://www.ms.unimelb.edu.au/) at the University of Melbourne and part of the [logic group](http://blogs.unimelb.edu.au/logic/). My CV is [here](http://therisingsea.org/cv.pdf) and you can contact me by [email](mailto:d.murfet@unimelb.edu.au) or find me [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/danielmurfet). My papers are [on the arXiv](http://arxiv.org/find/math/1/au:+Murfet_D/0/1/0/all/0/1) with the exception of my PhD thesis which you can find [here](http://therisingsea.org/thesis.pdf). My primary research interests are in algebraic geometry, category theory and mathematical logic. You can see some of the things I like to think about in my [Spring 2013 article in Emissary](https://www.msri.org/attachments/media/news/emissary/EmissarySpring2013.pdf) on matrix factorisations.

I have various code projects [on GitHub](https://github.com/dmurfet/) including my joint project with Nils Carqueville on [computing with matrix factorisations](https://github.com/dmurfet/mf), and my joint project with Huiyi Hu on [linear logic and deep learning](https://github.com/dmurfet/polysemantics).
