My name is Daniel Murfet, I am a mathematician in the [School of Mathematics and Statistics](http://www.ms.unimelb.edu.au/) at the University of Melbourne. My CV is [here](http://therisingsea.org/cv.pdf) and you can contact me by [email](mailto:d.murfet@unimelb.edu.au) or on [Discord](https://discord.gg/9yBaAxPSK8). My papers are [on the arXiv](https://arxiv.org/find/all/1/au:+murfet%5fdaniel/0/1/0/all/0/1) with the exception of my PhD thesis which you can find [here](http://therisingsea.org/thesis.pdf). I run a [seminar](http://therisingsea.org/post/seminar-ch/), the videos from which may be found on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJTk6uSbSsclXN8v3b27_QQ/videos?flow=list&live_view=500&view=0&sort=dd). The Rising Sea is now available :

<div align="center">**Universal office hours**: ask me about anything on the Rising Sea, in [the Metaverse](https://metauni.org) every Thursday 9:30am AEDT.</div>

My research interests are in algebraic geometry, mathematical logic and deep learning. You can see some of the things I like to think about in my [Spring 2013 article in Emissary](https://www.msri.org/attachments/media/news/emissary/EmissarySpring2013.pdf) on matrix factorisations and my [survey of linear logic](http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.2650). I am part of the [Melbourne Deep Learning Group](http://mdlg.ai). I have various code projects [on GitHub](https://github.com/dmurfet/) including my joint project with Nils Carqueville on [computing with matrix factorisations](https://github.com/dmurfet/mf).

The title of this webpage refers to the following quote from Grothendieck, which I learned from Colin McLarty's [article](http://www.cwru.edu/artsci/phil/RisingSea.pdf) "The Rising Sea: Grothendieck on Simplicity and Generality"

> A different image came to me a few weeks ago. The unknown thing to be known appeared to me as some stretch of earth or hard marl, resisting penetration ... the sea advances insensibly in silence, nothing seems to happen, nothing moves, the water is so far off you hardly hear it ... yet it finally surrounds the resistant substance.
