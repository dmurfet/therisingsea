title = "Mini-course on the fusion of defects"

+++

Recently I gave a [mini-course at the IBS in Korea](http://cgp.ibs.re.kr/activities/seminars/227/1476) on the fusion of defects in topological Landau-Ginzburg models. This included several computer demos, the source for which can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/dmurfet/mf).

*  Lecture 1: 2D TFT with defects and matrix factorisations ([lecture notes](http://therisingsea.org/notes/korea-lecture1.pdf)  and [video](https://vimeo.com/154577054)).
*  Lecture 2: The bicategory of Landau-Ginzburg models ([lecture notes](http://therisingsea.org/notes/korea-lecture2.pdf) and [video](https://vimeo.com/154711340)).
*  Lecture 3: The cut operation and computing fusions ([lecture notes](http://therisingsea.org/notes/korea-lecture3.pdf) and [video](https://vimeo.com/154843000)).

These lectures were made with the excellent [GoodNotes](http://www.goodnotesapp.com/) for the iPad Pro.
