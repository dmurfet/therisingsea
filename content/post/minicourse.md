I gave a [mini-course at the IBS in Korea](http://cgp.ibs.re.kr/conferences/MathematicalQuantumFieldTheory/) in January 2016 on topological field theory with defects, specifically the fusion of defects in topological Landau-Ginzburg models. This included several computer demos, the source for which can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/dmurfet/mf).
