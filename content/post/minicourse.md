Slides from my recent talks:

*  A-infinity algebras and minimal models [Part 1], May 2016 in Melbourne ([lecture notes](http://therisingsea.org/notes/talk-ainf-minimal.pdf) and [screencast](https://vimeo.com/165138188)).
*  Reading group on proof-nets, April 2016 in the Melbourne logic seminar ([handout 1](http://therisingsea.org/notes/logic-seminar-proofnets.pdf), [handout 2](http://therisingsea.org/notes/logic-seminar-proofnets2.pdf) and [notes](http://therisingsea.org/post/seminar-proofnets/)).
*  Stratifications and complexity in linear logic, March 2016 in the Melbourne logic seminar ([slides](http://therisingsea.org/notes/talk-stratifications.pdf) and [screencast](https://vimeo.com/160036378)).
*  An introduction to A-infinity algebras, November 2015 in the Melbourne Algebraic Topology seminar ([lecture notes](http://therisingsea.org/notes/ainf-intro-talk.pdf)).

I gave a [mini-course at the IBS in Korea](http://cgp.ibs.re.kr/conferences/MathematicalQuantumFieldTheory/) on topological field theory with defects, specifically the fusion of defects in topological Landau-Ginzburg models. This included several computer demos, the source for which can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/dmurfet/mf).

*  Lecture 1: 2D TFT with defects and matrix factorisations ([lecture notes](http://therisingsea.org/notes/korea-lecture1.pdf)  and [video](https://vimeo.com/154577054)).
*  Lecture 2: The bicategory of Landau-Ginzburg models ([lecture notes](http://therisingsea.org/notes/korea-lecture2.pdf) and [video](https://vimeo.com/154711340)).
*  Lecture 3: The cut operation and computing fusions ([lecture notes](http://therisingsea.org/notes/korea-lecture3.pdf) and [video](https://vimeo.com/154843000)).

These lectures were made with the excellent [GoodNotes](http://www.goodnotesapp.com/) for the iPad Pro.
