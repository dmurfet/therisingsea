title = "Mini-course on fusion of defects"

+++

Recently I gave a mini-course on the fusion of defects in topological Landau-Ginzburg models, for which I have posted the lecture notes:

*  [Lecture 1](http://therisingsea.org/notes/korea-lecture1.pdf): 2D TFT with defects and matrix factorisations.
*  [Lecture 2](http://therisingsea.org/notes/korea-lecture2.pdf): The bicategory of Landau-Ginzburg models.
*  [Lecture 3](http://therisingsea.org/notes/korea-lecture3.pdf): The cut operation and computing fusions.
