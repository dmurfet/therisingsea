This is the class webpage for the masters level course [MAST90068: Groups, Categories & Homological Algebra](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/view/2016/MAST90068). All classes are in Evan Williams, see the [timetable](https://sws.unimelb.edu.au/2016/Reports/List.aspx?objects=MAST90068&weeks=1-52&days=1-7&periods=1-56&template=module_by_group_list) for more details. Office hours will be on Tuesdays 12:30-2pm and Thursdays 10:30am-12pm, in Room 168.

#### Assessment

Up to 40 pages of assignments (30%: three assignments worth 10% each, due early, mid and late in semester), a 3-hour written examination (70%, in the examination period). 

In every lecture there will be assigned exercises (see the lecture notes posted below) and the three graded assignments will be largely made up of questions from those exercises. Ergo, keep up with the exercises and you'll be in good shape for the assessment.

#### Lecture notes

All lecture notes will be posted here before class:

* [Lecture 1](http://therisingsea.org/notes/mast90068/lecture1.pdf): Categories
* [Lecture 2](http://therisingsea.org/notes/mast90068/lecture2.pdf): Functors
* [Lecture 3](http://therisingsea.org/notes/mast90068/lecture3.pdf): Examples of functors, universal problems (*correction* 2-8-16)
* [Lecture 4](http://therisingsea.org/notes/mast90068/lecture4.pdf): Examples of functors, the simplex category (*correction* p.5 3-8-16)
* [Lecture 5](http://therisingsea.org/notes/mast90068/lecture5.pdf): Examples of functors, simplicial sets (*correction* 9-8-16)
* [Lecture 6](http://therisingsea.org/notes/mast90068/lecture6.pdf): The Yoneda lemma
* [Lecture 7](http://therisingsea.org/notes/mast90068/lecture7.pdf): Graphs versus categories

Besides these notes, you can find useful stuff [elsewhere on this website](http://therisingsea.org/post/notes/). Arun Ram's old website for this course has some gems, including a [guide for writing proofs](http://www.ms.unimelb.edu.au/~ram/Teaching/RepThy2010/grammarContent.pdf). In fact, you should spend an hour perusing the rest of his excellent website.

#### Assignments

Assignment 1 due Tuesday 23rd August in class:

* Lecture 2 Exercises 4, 5, 9, 11.
* Lecture 3 Exercise 2.
* Lecture 5 Exercise 3, 4.
* Lecture 6 Exercises 1, 2.
