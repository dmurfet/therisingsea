This is the class webpage for the masters level course [MAST90068: Groups, Categories & Homological Algebra](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/view/2016/MAST90068). All classes are in Evan Williams, see the [timetable](https://sws.unimelb.edu.au/2016/Reports/List.aspx?objects=MAST90068&weeks=1-52&days=1-7&periods=1-56&template=module_by_group_list) for more details. Office hours will be on Tuesdays 12:30-2pm and Thursdays 10:30am-12pm, in Room 168.

#### Assessment

Up to 40 pages of assignments (30%: three assignments worth 10% each, due early, mid and late in semester), a 3-hour written examination (70%, in the examination period). 

In every lecture there will be assigned exercises (see the lecture notes posted below) and the three graded assignments will be largely made up of questions from those exercises. Ergo, keep up with the exercises and you'll be in good shape for the assessment.

Some [remarks on Assignment 1](http://therisingsea.org/notes/mast90068/notes-assignment1.pdf).

**Assignment 2** due Tuesday 4th October **in class**:

* Lecture 10 Exercise 2.
* Lecture 11 Exercises 5,6.
* Lecture 12 Exercise 1.
* Lecture 13 Exercises 1,2.

A comment on the assignment questions from p.94 of Hilton & Stammbach. Question 2.5 asks you to check that the given formula makes E(A,B) into an abelian group. Q2.6 asks you to check that the functoriality in the first variable is linear with respect to this group structure. Q2.9 asks you to compute it in an example. This computation needs to be justified. You can justify it however you like, but the two obvious methods are: compute the group structure directly from the definition of Q2.5, OR prove that the isomorphism E(A,B) = Ext(A,B) that we discussed matches the natural abelian group structure on Ext(A,B) with the "new" structure on E(A,B) from Q2.5, and then use the (easy) calculation of Ext(A,B) from lectures.
