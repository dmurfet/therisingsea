This is the webpage for the Curry-Howard seminar at the University of Melbourne, which is on Tuesdays from 2-3pm in Room 107 of Richard Berry. The seminar has as its theme the growing field of connections between logic, functional programming and category theory, sometimes referred to as the Curry-Howard correspondence (or by the slogan "formulas-as-types, proofs-as-programs").
