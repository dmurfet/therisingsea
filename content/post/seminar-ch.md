This is the webpage for the [Curry-Howard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry%E2%80%93Howard_correspondence) seminar, which is about logic, categories and computation. The seminar is on **Thursdays from 2-3pm** in Room 107 of Peter Hall at the University of Melbourne. For announcements you can [subscribe](http://www.tinyletter.com/dmurfet) to the mailing list or follow the seminar [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/chseminar?lang=en). For previous semesters of the seminar, scroll down!

Our aim this semester is to understand how to use adjoint functors and topoi to organise mathematical knowledge, following Mac Lane and Moerdijk's book "Sheaves in Geometry and Logic". For an explanation of this aim see the [seminar announcement](http://therisingsea.org/notes/seminar-2018-sem1.pdf) and the first lecture below. For some additional motivation, see:

  * Caramello's paper "[The unification of mathematics via topos theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/1006.3930)",
  * Cartier's paper "[A mad day's work: from Grothendieck to Connes and Kontsevich](http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/2001-38-04/S0273-0979-01-00913-2/home.html)",
  * [Higher topoi](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/%28infinity%2C1%29-topos) are important in homotopy type theory,
  * Connes' talk on "[The arithmetic site](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaGXxXuRhBI)".
  
The seminar is supported by funding from [Data61](https://www.data61.csiro.au/), [DST group](https://www.dst.defence.gov.au/) and [ACEMS](https://acems.org.au/home) as part of a collaboration which aims to [develop new tools](http://therisingsea.org/notes/fmme.pdf) to aid human reasoning about mathematics and software.

### Previous semesters of the seminar
  
#### S2 2016

Our aim was to read Sorensen and Urzyczyn's book "Lectures on the Curry-Howard isomorphism", up to the proof of the original Curry-Howard correspondence (between simply-typed lambda calculus and intuitionistic logic) in Chapter 4.

  * 2-8 William Troiani "Introduction to lambda calculus" (Sections 1.1-1.3, [lecture notes](http://therisingsea.org/notes/talk-will-lambda.pdf))
  * 9-8 Samuel Lyons "All partial recursive functions are lambda-definable" (Section 1.7, [lecture notes](http://therisingsea.org/notes/talk-sam-definable.pdf))

* The functional programming language Haskell compiles to an extension of System F. There was a recent [blog post](http://www.stephendiehl.com/posts/ghc_03.html) by Stephen Diehl on this, and a [talk by Simon Peyton Jones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uR_VzYxvbxg).

* Videos from the [ICFP 2016](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwRL68qZFfub1Ep1EScfmBw?app=desktop) functional programming conference.
  
* Videos from a recent functional programming conference [Compose](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNoHgLVTxtaqo1c_V2I-8wkDrCGImb9v5&app=desktop) in Melbourne.
  
* Video of Yann LeCun on [Deep Learning and the Future of AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wofXCQXq1pg). Perhaps there is a missing *differentiable* column in the Curry-Howard correspondence. From 49:30 of the video: "Analogy through algebra: this is very important because a lot of us have been thinking that reasoning should not be done through logic or rules, but should be done through continuous mathematics. And the reason for that is that instead of symbols you have vectors, instead of logical operations you have continuous mathematical operations like linear algebra. The reason for doing is that is that now every operation the machine does is differentiable, so you can train it to do reasoning." (see 55:00 for memory).
