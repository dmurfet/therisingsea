The seminar is held at irregular times in Room 107 of Peter Hall. For announcements of talks [subscribe](http://www.tinyletter.com/dmurfet) to the mailing list. The videos from the talks are available on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/channels/1356315) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJTk6uSbSsclXN8v3b27_QQ/videos?flow=list&live_view=500&view=0&sort=dd). For previous semesters of the seminar, scroll down!

Our aim of semester two 2018 was to understand **how to use adjoint functors and topoi to organise mathematical knowledge**, following Mac Lane and Moerdijk's book "Sheaves in Geometry and Logic". For an explanation of this aim see the [seminar announcement](http://therisingsea.org/notes/seminar-2018-sem1.pdf) and the first lecture below. The seminar is supported by funding from [Data61](https://www.data61.csiro.au/), [DST group](https://www.dst.defence.gov.au/) and [ACEMS](https://acems.org.au/home) as part of a collaboration which aims to [develop new tools](http://therisingsea.org/notes/fmme.pdf) to aid human reasoning about mathematics and software.
