This is the webpage for the Curry-Howard seminar at the University of Melbourne. Currently in very rough shape.
  
The main reference is:

  * Sorensen, Urzycz "Lectures on the Curry-Howard isomorphism".
  * Related [lecture notes](http://disi.unitn.it/~bernardi/RSISE11/Papers/curry-howard.pdf), seems to be a draft version of the book.
