This is the webpage for the Curry-Howard seminar at the University of Melbourne, which is on Tuesdays from 2-3pm in Room 107 of Richard Berry. The seminar has as its theme the growing field of connections between logic, functional programming and category theory, sometimes referred to as the [Curry-Howard correspondence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry%E2%80%93Howard_correspondence) (or by the slogan "formulas-as-types, proofs-as-programs"). To receive announcements about the seminar [subscribe](http://www.tinyletter.com/dmurfet) to the mailing list. You should also check out the [Logic Seminar](http://blogs.unimelb.edu.au/logic/logic-seminar/) which has talks on more recent research in logic.

Our aim is to read Sorensen and Urzyczyn's book "Lectures on the Curry-Howard isomorphism", up to the proof of the original Curry-Howard correspondence (between simply-typed lambda calculus and intuitionistic logic) in Chapter 4, and to augment this with a third equivalence which involves category theory.

As a general introduction, I recommend Philip Wadler's famous talk [Propositions as types](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOiZatlZtGU).

#### Other

  * The functional programming language Haskell compiles internally to an extension of System F, which is discussed in Sorensen and Urzycz's text and is an extension of simply-typed lambda calculus. There was a recent [blog post](http://www.stephendiehl.com/posts/ghc_03.html) by Stephen Diehl exploring how Haskell compiles to System F.
