This is the webpage for my seminar, the topic of which varies from semester to semester.  The seminar is on **Wednesdays from 3-4:30pm** in Room 107 of Peter Hall at the University of Melbourne. For announcements you can [subscribe](http://www.tinyletter.com/dmurfet) to the mailing list, follow the seminar [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/chseminar?lang=en), or see all the videos on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/channels/1356315) or [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJTk6uSbSsclXN8v3b27_QQ/videos?flow=list&live_view=500&view=0&sort=dd). For previous semesters of the seminar, scroll down!

Our aim this semester is to understand **how to use adjoint functors and topoi to organise mathematical knowledge**, following Mac Lane and Moerdijk's book "Sheaves in Geometry and Logic". For an explanation of this aim see the [seminar announcement](http://therisingsea.org/notes/seminar-2018-sem1.pdf) and the first lecture below. For some additional motivation, see:

  * Caramello's paper "[The unification of mathematics via topos theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/1006.3930)",
  * Cartier's paper "[A mad day's work: from Grothendieck to Connes and Kontsevich](http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/2001-38-04/S0273-0979-01-00913-2/home.html)",
  * [Higher topoi](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/%28infinity%2C1%29-topos) are important in homotopy type theory,
  * Connes' talk on "[The arithmetic site](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaGXxXuRhBI)".
  
The seminar is supported by funding from [Data61](https://www.data61.csiro.au/), [DST group](https://www.dst.defence.gov.au/) and [ACEMS](https://acems.org.au/home) as part of a collaboration which aims to [develop new tools](http://therisingsea.org/notes/fmme.pdf) to aid human reasoning about mathematics and software.

Our aim was to read Sorensen and Urzyczyn's book "Lectures on the Curry-Howard isomorphism", up to the proof of the original Curry-Howard correspondence (between simply-typed lambda calculus and intuitionistic logic) in Chapter 4.
