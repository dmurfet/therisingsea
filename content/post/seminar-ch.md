The seminar has as its theme the growing field of connections between logic, functional programming and category theory, sometimes referred to as the [Curry-Howard correspondence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry%E2%80%93Howard_correspondence) (or by the slogan "formulas-as-types, proofs-as-programs"). To receive announcements about the seminar [subscribe](http://www.tinyletter.com/dmurfet) to the mailing list. You should also check out the [Logic Seminar](http://blogs.unimelb.edu.au/logic/logic-seminar/) which has talks on more recent research in logic. **NOTE:** This is the webpage for the 2016 seminar, see [this page](http://therisingsea.org/post/seminar-ch-2018/) for the current seminar.

Our aim is to read Sorensen and Urzyczyn's book "Lectures on the Curry-Howard isomorphism", up to the proof of the original Curry-Howard correspondence (between simply-typed lambda calculus and intuitionistic logic) in Chapter 4, and to augment this with a third equivalence which involves category theory.

#### Other

* The functional programming language Haskell compiles to an extension of System F. There was a recent [blog post](http://www.stephendiehl.com/posts/ghc_03.html) by Stephen Diehl on this, and a [talk by Simon Peyton Jones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uR_VzYxvbxg).

* An interesting [podcast](http://typetheorypodcast.com/) on Type Theory.
  
* Videos from the [ICFP 2016](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwRL68qZFfub1Ep1EScfmBw?app=desktop) functional programming conference.
  
* Videos from a recent functional programming conference [Compose](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNoHgLVTxtaqo1c_V2I-8wkDrCGImb9v5&app=desktop) in Melbourne.
  
* Video of Yann LeCun on [Deep Learning and the Future of AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wofXCQXq1pg). Perhaps there is a missing *differentiable* column in the Curry-Howard correspondence. From 49:30 of the video: "Analogy through algebra: this is very important because a lot of us have been thinking that reasoning should not be done through logic or rules, but should be done through continuous mathematics. And the reason for that is that instead of symbols you have vectors, instead of logical operations you have continuous mathematical operations like linear algebra. The reason for doing is that is that now every operation the machine does is differentiable, so you can train it to do reasoning." (see 55:00 for memory).
