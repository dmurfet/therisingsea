Mass surveillance is a serious threat to the ideal of free thinking which makes mathematics (and other beautiful things) possible. Moreover, the technologies which enable it (e.g. machine learning) and the technologies which can be used to [protect oneself](https://ssd.eff.org/en) from it (e.g. encryption) are themselves mathematical. Soon after the Snowden leaks my friend [Nils Carqueville](http://nils.carqueville.net/) and I wrote [an essay](http://nils.carqueville.net/MassSurveillanceEssay.pdf) on this subject, which you might find interesting.
