My interest in the mathematical theory of computation is primarily due to the work of the brilliant logician [Jean-Yves Girard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Yves_Girard) on [linear logic](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-linear/). Below is a (not very comprehensive) list of references for the parts of the theory of computation that I either know a little about, or am interested in. The books can generally be downloaded in PDF form from [bookzz](http://www.bookzz.org), but do buy a copy as well.

General "big picture" references on computation and logic:

*  [The Nature of Computation](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-nature-of-computation-9780199233212?cc=us&lang=en&), a textbook by Cristopher Moore and Stephan Mertens.
*  [Towards a geometry of interaction](https://jb55.com/linear/pdf/Towards%20a%20geometry%20of%20interaction.pdf) by Jean-Yves Girard.
*  [The Blind Spot](http://iml.univ-mrs.fr/~girard/coursang/coursang.html) also by Girard, quite eclectic and unpolished, but full of interesting ideas (especially the sections on Russell's paradox and complexity).
*  [Constructive mathematics and computer programming](http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/cs257/archive/per-martin-lof/constructive-math.pdf) by Martin-Lof.
*  [Two puzzles about computation](http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.4880) by Samson Abramsky.

Some references on lambda-calculus, System F and proof theory:

*  [Proofs and types](http://www.paultaylor.eu/stable/prot.pdf) by Jean-Yves Girard.

Some references on computational complexity theory:

*  [Why philosophers should care about computational complexity](http://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/philos.pdf) by Scott Aaronson.
*  [Topological views on computational complexity](http://stationq.cnsi.ucsb.edu/~freedman/Publications/67.pdf) by Michael Freedman (Fields medallist and now [director of Station Q](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/press/mfreedman.aspx)).
*  [Light linear logic](http://iml.univ-mrs.fr/~girard/LLL.pdf.gz) by Jean-Yves Girard.
*  [Light logic and polynomial time computation](http://www.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~terui/phd.pdf) by Kazushige Terui.

Relations between computation and category theory:

*  [Lectures on the Curry-Howard isomorphism](https://www.elsevier.com/books/lectures-on-the-curry-howard-isomorphism/srensen/978-0-444-52077-7) by Morten Heine Sorensen and Pawel Urzyczyn.
*  [Physics, Topology, Logic and Computation:
A Rosetta Stone](http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/rosetta.pdf) by John Baez and Mike Stay.
*  [Categorical semantics of linear logic](http://www.pps.univ-paris-diderot.fr/~mellies/mpri/mpri-ens/biblio/categorical-semantics-of-linear-logic.pdf) by Paul-Andre Mellies.
*  [Notions of computation and monads](https://core.ac.uk/download/files/145/21173011.pdf) by Eugenio Moggi.
*  [Homotopy type theory](http://homotopytypetheory.org/) is a semantics of Martin-Lof type theory defined using homotopy-theory.

Relations between computation and physics:

*  [The Feynman lectures on computation](http://www.amazon.com/Feynman-Lectures-On-Computation-Richard/dp/0738202967), seminal work in the field of quantum computing, also has a good discussion of basics including Bennett's work on irreversibility (find a PDF on bookzz).
*  [Complexity and phase transitions](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/selman/papers/pdf/99.nature.phase.pdf), Nature paper from 1999.
*  There is a deep and interesting connection between Maxwell's demon and topics in computation, for which see [Szilard](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/complex/tlusty/courses/InfoInBio/Papers/Szilard1929.pdf), [Brillouin](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1961AmJPh..29..318B), [Landauer](http://worrydream.com/refs/Landauer%20-%20Irreversibility%20and%20Heat%20Generation%20in%20the%20Computing%20Process.pdf) and the papers of Bennett below.
*  [The thermodynamics of computation](http://www.pitt.edu/~jdnorton/lectures/Rotman_Summer_School_2013/thermo_computing_docs/Bennett_1982.pdf) by Bennett 1982.
*  [Time-space tradeoffs for reversible computation](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.364.3669&rep=rep1&type=pdf) by Bennett.
