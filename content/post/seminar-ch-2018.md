This is the webpage for the Curry-Howard seminar at the University of Melbourne, which is on **Thursdays from 2-3pm** in Room 107 of Peter Hall. The seminar has as its theme the growing field of connections between logic, functional programming and category theory, sometimes referred to as the [Curry-Howard correspondence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry%E2%80%93Howard_correspondence) (or by the slogan "formulas-as-types, proofs-as-programs"). To receive announcements about the seminar [subscribe](http://www.tinyletter.com/dmurfet) to the mailing list. 

Our aim this semester is to understand how to use adjoint functors and topoi to organise mathematical knowledge, following Mac Lane and Moerdijk's book "Sheaves in Geometry and Logic". For an explanation of this aim see the [seminar announcement](http://therisingsea.org/notes/seminar-2018-sem1.pdf) and the first lecture below. For some additional motivation, see:

  * Caramello's paper "[The unification of mathematics via topos theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/1006.3930)",
  * Cartier's paper "[A mad day's work: from Grothendieck to Connes and Kontsevich](http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/2001-38-04/S0273-0979-01-00913-2/home.html)",
  * [Higher topoi](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/%28infinity%2C1%29-topos) are important in homotopy type theory.
  * Connes' talk on "[The arithmetic site](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaGXxXuRhBI)".
  
The seminar is supported by funding from [Data61](https://www.data61.csiro.au/), [DST group](https://www.dst.defence.gov.au/) and [ACEMS](https://acems.org.au/home) as part of a collaboration which aims to [develop new tools](http://therisingsea.org/notes/fmme.pdf) to aid human reasoning about mathematics and software.
