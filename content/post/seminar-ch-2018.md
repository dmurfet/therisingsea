This is the webpage for the Curry-Howard seminar at the University of Melbourne, which is on Thursdays from 3-4pm in Room 107 of Peter Hall. The seminar has as its theme the growing field of connections between logic, functional programming and category theory, sometimes referred to as the [Curry-Howard correspondence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry%E2%80%93Howard_correspondence) (or by the slogan "formulas-as-types, proofs-as-programs"). To receive announcements about the seminar [subscribe](http://www.tinyletter.com/dmurfet) to the mailing list. 

Our aim this semester is to understand how to use adjoint functors and topoi to organise mathematical knowledge, following Mac Lane and Moerdijk's book "Sheaves in Geometry and Logic". For more explanation see the [seminar announcement](http://therisingsea.org/notes/seminar-2018-sem1.pdf).

The seminar is supported by funding from [Data61](https://www.data61.csiro.au/), [DST group](https://www.dst.defence.gov.au/) and [ACEMS](https://acems.org.au/home).
