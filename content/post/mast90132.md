This is the webpage for [MAST90132: Lie Algebras](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/subjects/mast90132). The lectures (Evan Williams Tues 3:15-4:15pm, Wed 10-11am and Fri 10-11am) will be delivered in person but also through Zoom (see the LMS page for the link). Office hours are Wed 11am-12pm and Friday 11am-1pm on the same Zoom meeting ID. There will be four assignments due at regular intervals during semester amounting to a total of 40%, and a 3-hour written examination in the examination period worth 60%.

### 2021 Lectures

The ground truth of this subject is to be found in the lecture notes, which contain all details and which will be posted before each lecture. For background on topology and Hilbert spaces you may wish to consult my [MAST30026 page](http://therisingsea.org/post/mast30026/).

* Lecture 1: What is real? ([notes](http://therisingsea.org/notes/mast90132/lecture1.pdf))
* Lecture 2: Wigner's theorem ([notes](http://therisingsea.org/notes/mast90132/lecture2.pdf))
* Lecture 3: Symmetries of Hilbert space ([notes](http://therisingsea.org/notes/mast90132/lecture3.pdf))
* Lecture 4: Infinitesimal symmetries ([notes](http://therisingsea.org/notes/mast90132/lecture4.pdf))
* Lecture 5: Angular momentum ([notes](http://therisingsea.org/notes/mast90132/lecture5.pdf))
* Background 1: Matrix exponentials ([notes](http://therisingsea.org/notes/mast90132/background1.pdf))
* Background 2: Category theory ([notes](http://therisingsea.org/notes/mast90132/background2.pdf))
* Lecture 6: Lie groups and Lie algebras ([notes](http://therisingsea.org/notes/mast90132/lecture6.pdf))

There is a bonus lecture (not examinable):

* Lecture 8: Complex Lie groups and spin

**Assignment 1** due by 4pm on 22-3:

**Assignment 2** due by 4pm on 23-4:

* Exercise L3-6 (*everything rotates*), Exercise L3B-2 (*sheaf condition*), Exercise L3-13 (*Laplacian vs Laplacian*)
* Exercise L4-4 (*families of operators*), Exercise L4-6 (*suspicious formula*), Exercise L4-8 (*E pur si muove*)

**Assignment 3** due by 4pm on 14-5:

* Exercise B1-2 (*exponentials acting*), Exercise B1-5 (*trace vs det*), Exercise B1-6 (*Heisenberg*)
* Exercise L5-3 (*skew vs unitary*)

**Assignment 4** due by 4pm on 28-5:

* Exercise L6-4 (*commutator*), Exercise L6-5 (*fullness*)

#### Exam

All but one of the questions on the exam will be questions that are either *exactly the same as* exercises assigned in lectures, or which are very similar. To be clear, exercises which appear on the exam may not have appeared on any homework assignment, and may not have solutions provided in the lecture notes. The question on the exam which is not an exercise from the notes will ask you to reproduce one of the proofs (an explicit list of those proofs which might appear will be given before the end of semester).
