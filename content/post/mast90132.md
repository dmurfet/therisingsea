This is the webpage for [MAST90132: Lie Algebras](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/subjects/mast90132). The lectures (Evan Williams Tues 3:15-4:15pm, Wed 10-11am and Fri 10-11am) will be delivered in person but also through the following virtual channels:

* **Zoom**: video stream of the lecture room plus audio feed
* **Metauni**: virtual whiteboards in Roblox plus a Discord audio feed

Metauni is a network of virtual worlds with a 3D virtual environment provided by [Roblox](https://www.roblox.com/) and location-specific voice chat using [Discord](https://www.discord.com/). See the [metauni page](https://metauni.org) for instructions on how it works, but in short you can joint a MAST90132 lecture by

* Installing Roblox and Discord and making accounts
* Load the [Enveloping Algebra](https://www.roblox.com/games/6461013759/Enveloping-Algebra) Roblox world
* Join the `General` voice channel in the MAST90132 [Discord](https://discord.gg/4UW2xfnZnR) server

There will be a volunteer in each lecture acting as scribe, as described in the page on metauni [dual spaces](https://metauni.org/posts/dual/dual). The [Discord](https://discord.gg/4UW2xfnZnR) is the main social channel for the subject. Office hours are 11am-12pm on Wednesdays and 11am-1pm on Fridays, on the same Zoom meeting ID as the lectures.

There will be four assignments due at regular intervals during semester amounting to a total of 40%, and a 3-hour written examination in the examination period worth 60%.

### 2021 lectures

The ground truth of this subject is to be found in the lecture notes, which contain all details and which will be posted before each lecture (generally the night before). For Lie algebras and their representations we will generally follow [David Ridout's notes](http://therisingsea.org/notes/mast90132/lienotes.pdf) but at the beginning of semester my approach will be different. For background on topology and Hilbert spaces you may wish to consult my [MAST30026 page](http://therisingsea.org/post/mast30026/)

* Lecture 1: What is real? ([notes](http://therisingsea.org/notes/mast90132/lecture1.pdf))
* Lecture 2: Wigner's theorem ([notes](http://therisingsea.org/notes/mast90132/lecture2.pdf))
* Lecture 3: Symmetries of Hilbert space ([notes](http://therisingsea.org/notes/mast90132/lecture3.pdf))

Thanks to the scribes: Liam Carroll, Will Troiani and Edmund Lau Tiew Hong.

#### Exam

The bulk of the exam will be questions that are either *exactly the same as* exercises assigned in lectures, or which are very similar. The questions will be at a level of difficulty below the one-star exercises (there will be one *part* of one question at the level of the easiest one-star problem). To be clear, exercises which appear on the exam may not have appeared on any homework assignment, and may not have solutions provided in the lecture notes.
