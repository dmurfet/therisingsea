This is the webpage for [MAST90132: Lie Algebras](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/subjects/mast90132). The lectures (Evan Williams Tues 3:15-4:15pm, Wed 10-11am and Fri 10-11am) will be delivered physically  and hopefully virtually at the same time via Zoom, or failing that by lecture capture. The [Discord](https://discord.gg/4UW2xfnZnR) is the main social channel for the subject. Office hours are 11-11:30am on Wednesdays and 11-1:30pm on Fridays (Zoom only for now).

There will be four assignments due at regular intervals during semester amounting to a total of 40%, and a 3-hour written examination in the examination period worth 60%.

### 2021 lectures

The ground truth of this subject is to be found in the lecture notes, which contain all details and which will be posted before each lecture (generally the night before). For Lie algebras and their representations we will generally follow [David Ridout's notes](http://therisingsea.org/notes/mast90132/lienotes.pdf) but at the beginning of semester my approach will be different. For background on topology and Hilbert spaces you may wish to consult my [MAST30026 page](http://therisingsea.org/post/mast30026/)

* Lecture 1: What is real?

#### Exam

The bulk of the exam will be questions that are either *exactly the same as* exercises assigned in lectures, or which are very similar. The questions will be at a level of difficulty below the one-star exercises (there will be one *part* of one question at the level of the easiest one-star problem). To be clear, exercises which appear on the exam may not have appeared on any homework assignment, and may not have solutions provided in the lecture notes.

The Exam will be Zoom invigilated and *will not* be open book. You should carefully read the [exam advice](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/112463/pages/exam-advice?module_item_id=2125506) prepared by the School of Mathematics and Statistics and I recommend watching the video [here](https://students.unimelb.edu.au/your-course/manage-your-course/exams-assessments-and-results/exams/how-do-i-take-my-exam/formats/maths-and-statistics). Our exam will be a "variable length Gradescope exam". This means that you will, at the beginning of the exam, be able to access the exam paper as a PDF on Canvas (which you either print or view on a device which is subsequently disconnected from the Internet). You write your solutions on blank pieces of paper, which you then scan and upload at the end of the exam. You should download and practice with a dedicated scanning app such as Camscanner, Scannable or OfficeLens. *Do not plan to rely on the phone camera app*. There will be announcement of times to practice the upload procedure during the week before the exam. The [cover sheet](http://therisingsea.org/notes/mast30026/exam-2020-coversheet.pdf) is now available.

#### Index of topics covered

The following topics appear in the lecture notes. Those topics in the lecture notes or exercises but not discussed out loud during lectures are given in italics:
