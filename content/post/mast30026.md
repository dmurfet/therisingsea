This is the class webpage for the course [MAST30026: Metric and Hilbert spaces](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/subjects/mast30026). There will be three assignments due at regular intervals during semester amounting to a total of 20%, and a 3-hour written examination in the examination period worth 80%. Office hours will be Wednesdays 2-3pm, Thursdays 2-3pm and Fridays 11am-12pm in Room 168.

Lecture notes will be posted here before class, and the videos will be posted once they are edited (usually within a day or two). Note that the "lectures" below are coherent units of content which may end up spread over one or more actual lectures, hence the multiple videos per "lecture". Note that you may need to manually change the quality setting on YouTube to HD in order to be able to read the board.

**2019 edition:** from Lecture 4 you can ignore everything except for Lemma L4-1 and Exercise L4-0. We will skip Lecture 5 entirely. The proof of Theorem L11-4 (finite CW-complexes are Hausdorff) will be covered by tutorials, and the Bellman equation (part of Lecture 15) will also not be covered in lectures. These cuts are to make time for material on operators on Hilbert space, the spectral theorem, quantum mechanics and harmonic functions at the end of semester.

Ergo, keep up with the exercises and you'll be in good shape for the assessment. Assignments are to be **submitted to the assignment box of your tutor** (Box 191 for Patrick and 192 for Daniel).

**Assignment 1** due by 4pm on 27-8:

* Exercise L6-7 (*germs*)
* Exercise L6-8, L6-9, L6-10 (*Lipschitz equivalence*)
* Exercise L7-1 (*bases*)
* Exercise L7-6 (*disjoint union topology*)

#### Material from 2018

These are the old assignments, which I am leaving online since they should be useful.

The bulk of the exam will be questions that are either *exactly the same as* exercises assigned in lectures, or which are very similar. The questions will be at a level of difficulty below the one-star exercises (there will be one *part* of one question at the level of the easiest one-star problem). To be clear, exercises which appear on the exam may not have appeared on any homework assignment, and may not have solutions provided in the lecture notes. Questions assigned in tutorials which do *not* have provided solutions are guaranteed to not appear on the exam.

In addition to these "exercise style" questions, there will be at least one **proof** from the lectures that you will be asked to give in the exam. The following results are explicitly **excluded**:

* Theorem on p.8 of L5 (*Lorentz group*)
* Theorem L8-2 (*Bolzano-Weierstrass*)
* Theorem L9-2 (*sequentially compact iff. compact*)
* Theorem L11-4 (*finite CW-complexes are compact Hausdorff*)
* Theorem L12-4 (*adjunction property*)
* Theorem L12-7 (*compact-open topology vs. closed graphs*)
* Exercise L14-2 (*Bellman equation*)
* Theorem L16-0 (*Weierstrass approximation*)
* Lemma L16-0.5 (*Bernstein polynomials*)
* Theorem L16-3 (*Stone-Weierstrass*)
* Theorem L18-1 (*L^p-norm and Holder inequality*)
* Lemma L19-1 (*characterisation of finite dimension*)
* Lemma L20-11 (*conspiracy avoidance*)

#### Applications

The focus of the class will be on important examples of spaces and proving theorems, but this material is widely used outside of pure mathematics and I want to do justice to that fact. To that end, in the last lecture of the first week I asked you all to write down your [areas of interest](https://gist.github.com/dmurfet/327844cf4b4cc842718277642f041f8a). As I fill in the material of the course, I'll try to keep a running list here of topics (that we have either covered already, or that we plan to cover in future lectures) relevant to each of the areas of interest that you've elected:

* Applied mathematics: [Existence of solutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picard%E2%80%93Lindel%C3%B6f_theorem) to differential equations, [Calculus of variations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_variations).
* Physics: Special relativity, [Wigner's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wigner%27s_theorem), ... well, Hilbert spaces!
* Computer science: [Bellman equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman_equation) used in [reinforcement learning](https://joshgreaves.com/reinforcement-learning/understanding-rl-the-bellman-equations/) (see Lecture 14).
* Probability and statistics: [Kullback-Leibler divergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence) and [information metrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher_information_metric).

Unfortunately I do not know any specific applications in biology or chemistry, although there is obviously plenty of quantum mechanics in chemistry and applied math in biology (please let me know if you know more domain-specific applications). You might also find [spaces of programs](https://gist.github.com/dmurfet/688af9d4413cbb9a13ca5d50b28ddcbc) interesting, although this is outside the scope of this course.
