This is the class webpage for the course [MAST30026: Metric and Hilbert spaces](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/subjects/mast30026). Office hours will be 10am-11:45am on Mondays and 3:15pm-4:30pm on Thursdays, in Room 168. There will be three assignments due at regular intervals during semester amounting to a total of 20%, and a 3-hour written examination in the examination period worth 80%.

#### Lecture notes and videos

Lecture notes will be posted here before class, and the videos will be posted once they are edited (usually within a day or two). Note that the "lectures" below are coherent units of content which may end up spread over one or more actual lectures, hence the multiple videos per "lecture". Note that you may need to manually change the quality setting on YouTube to HD in order to be able to read the board.

My aim is to prove the following theorems by the end of the semester. As you may have noticed, this is an evolving list:

* [Banach fixed point theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach_fixed-point_theorem)

This is an article by [Boaz Barak](https://www.boazbarak.org), a professor of Computer Science at Harvard and author of a popular textbook on [computational complexity](http://theory.cs.princeton.edu/complexity/), on the AdS/CFT correspondence, which hints at (among many other things) a possible role for computational complexity in understanding the "ultimate" nature of spacetime. Note that this is far from settled science!

There is no set text, but the following books may be useful:

- N. Bourbaki, "General topology" Chapters 1-4
- K. Wysocki, H. Rubinstein "[Metric and topological spaces](http://metis.ms.unimelb.edu.au/~s620311/pdf/NewMetric07.pdf)"
- T. Tao "Analysis" Vol. II (for metric spaces)
- J. R. Munkres "Topology" (for topological spaces)

#### Assignments

In every lecture there will be assigned exercises and the three graded assignments will be largely made up of questions from those exercises. Ergo, keep up with the exercises and you'll be in good shape for the assessment. Assignments are to be **submitted to the assignment box of your tutor** (Box 191 for Patrick and 192 for Daniel).

**Assignment 1** due by 4pm on 17-8:

* Exercise L2-3
* Exercise L3-3, L3-4, L3-5
* Exercise L4-0, L4-4

**Assignment 2** due by 4pm on 7-9:

* Exercise L5-7
* Exercise L6-3
* Exercise L7-2, L7-10, L7-12, L7-19
* Exercise L8-5
* Exercise L9-5

**Assignment 3** will be assigned on 10-9 and due 5-10

#### Applications

The focus of the class will be on important examples of spaces and proving theorems, but this material is widely used outside of pure mathematics and I want to do justice to that fact. To that end, in the last lecture of the first week I asked you all to write down your [areas of interest](https://gist.github.com/dmurfet/327844cf4b4cc842718277642f041f8a). As I fill in the material of the course, I'll try to keep a running list here of topics (that we have either covered already, or that we plan to cover in future lectures) relevant to each of the areas of interest that you've elected:

* Applied mathematics: [Existence of solutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picard%E2%80%93Lindel%C3%B6f_theorem) to differential equations, [Calculus of variations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_variations).
* Physics: Special relativity, [Wigner's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wigner%27s_theorem), ... well, Hilbert spaces!
* Computer science: [Bellman equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman_equation) used in [reinforcement learning](https://joshgreaves.com/reinforcement-learning/understanding-rl-the-bellman-equations/).
* Probability and statistics: [Kullback-Leibler divergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence) and [information metrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher_information_metric).

Unfortunately I do not know any specific applications in biology or chemistry, although there is obviously plenty of quantum mechanics in chemistry and applied math in biology (please let me know if you know more domain-specific applications). You might also find [spaces of programs](https://gist.github.com/dmurfet/688af9d4413cbb9a13ca5d50b28ddcbc) interesting, although this is outside the scope of this course.
