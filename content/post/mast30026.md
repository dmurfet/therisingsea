This is the class webpage for the course [MAST30026: Metric and Hilbert spaces](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/subjects/mast30026). Office hours will be **TBD**, in Room 168.

#### Assessment

There will be three assignments due at regular intervals during semester amounting to a total of 20%, and a 3-hour written examination in the examination period worth 80%.

In every lecture there will be assigned exercises (see the lecture notes posted below) and the three graded assignments will be largely made up of questions from those exercises. Ergo, keep up with the exercises and you'll be in good shape for the assessment. Note that the "lectures" below are coherent units of content which may end up spread over one or more actual lectures, hence the multiple videos per "lecture".

#### Lecture notes

All lecture notes will be posted here before class:

* Lecture 1: What is space? ([lecture notes](http://therisingsea.org/notes/mast30026/lecture1.pdf) | [video1](https://youtu.be/xun4c-NXgW8) | [video2](https://youtu.be/Zvx_mHnAOjc))
* Lecture 2: Examples of spaces ([lecture notes](http://therisingsea.org/notes/mast30026/lecture2.pdf) | [video1](https://youtu.be/K_5D2qrVnVY) | [video2](https://youtu.be/zZ8pqEaCub0))
* Lecture 3: Isometries ([lecture notes](http://therisingsea.org/notes/mast30026/lecture3.pdf) | [video1](https://youtu.be/CRghZUfiK9Y))

Tentative future schedule:

* Lecture 4: Metrics from matrices
* Lecture 5: Minkowski space and special relativity
* Lecture 6: Function spaces
* Lecture 7: The Banach fixed point theorem
* Lecture 8: Control theory and the Bellman equation
