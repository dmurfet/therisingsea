This is the class webpage for the course [MAST30026: Metric and Hilbert spaces](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/subjects/mast30026). Office hours will be **TBD**, in Room 168.

#### Assessment

There will be three assignments due at regular intervals during semester amounting to a total of 20%, and a 3-hour written examination in the examination period worth 80%.

In every lecture there will be assigned exercises (see the lecture notes posted below) and the three graded assignments will be largely made up of questions from those exercises. Ergo, keep up with the exercises and you'll be in good shape for the assessment. Note that the "lectures" below are coherent units of content which may end up spread over one or more actual lectures, hence the multiple videos per "lecture".

The focus of the class will be on important examples of spaces and proving theorems, but this material is widely used outside of pure mathematics and I want to do justice to that fact. To that end, in the last lecture of the first week I asked you all to write down your [areas of interest](https://gist.github.com/dmurfet/327844cf4b4cc842718277642f041f8a). As I fill in the material of the course, I'll try to keep a running list here of topics (that we have either covered already, or that we plan to cover in future lectures) relevant to each of the areas of interest that you've elected:

* Applied mathematics: Existence of solutions to PDEs (application of the fixed point theorem), calculus of variations.
* Physics: Special relativity, [Wigner's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wigner%27s_theorem), ... well, Hilbert spaces!
* Computer science: [Bellman equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman_equation) used in [reinforcement learning](https://joshgreaves.com/reinforcement-learning/understanding-rl-the-bellman-equations/).
* Probability and statistics: [Kullback-Leibler divergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence) and [information metrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher_information_metric).

Unfortunately I do not know any applications to biology or chemistry (that does not mean there are none, it just means I am ignorant).

#### Lecture notes

All lecture notes will be posted here before class:
