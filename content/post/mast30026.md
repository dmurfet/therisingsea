This is the webpage for [MAST30026: Metric and Hilbert spaces](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/subjects/mast30026). The subject consists of lectures, a weekly tutorial and office hours. The complete course notes are available below, and the 2018 recordings are [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKnx70LRf21eSXaawNhiCCPrzsbLdT5do). There is a public [Discord](https://discord.gg/Cshg55m) where you can join other people studying the material. Office hours are 10-11:30 Tuesday and 11-12:30 Friday (same Zoom meeting ID as the lectures).

There will be three assignments due at regular intervals during semester amounting to a total of 20%, and a 3-hour written examination in the examination period worth 80%. There are *no tutorials in week one*.

# 2021

The ground truth of this subject is to be found in the lecture notes. It is explicitly intended that you will not be disadvantaged if you choose the YouTube videos over live lectures (or vice versa). In fact I expect most of you will choose a mix of the two. Markers like *{28-7}* indicate the day the lecture was finished in class.

## Exam 2021

The bulk of the exam will be questions that are either *exactly the same as* exercises assigned in lectures, or which are very similar. The questions will be at a level of difficulty below the one-star exercises (there will be one *part* of one question at the level of the easiest one-star problem). To be clear, exercises which appear on the exam may not have appeared on any homework assignment, and may not have solutions provided in the lecture notes. Questions that appear only in tutorials *will not* appear on the exam. **The exam from 2018 is available** [here](http://therisingsea.org/notes/mast30026/exam-2018.pdf) with [solutions](http://therisingsea.org/notes/mast30026/exam-2018-soln.pdf). 

The Exam will be Zoom invigilated and *will not* be open book. You should carefully read the [exam advice](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/112463/pages/exam-advice?module_item_id=2125506) prepared by the School of Mathematics and Statistics and I recommend watching the video [here](https://students.unimelb.edu.au/your-course/manage-your-course/exams-assessments-and-results/exams/how-do-i-take-my-exam/formats/maths-and-statistics). Our exam will be a "variable length Gradescope exam". This means that you will, at the beginning of the exam, be able to access the exam paper as a PDF on Canvas (which you either print or view on a device which is subsequently disconnected from the Internet). You write your solutions on blank pieces of paper, which you then scan and upload at the end of the exam. You should download and practice with a dedicated scanning app such as Camscanner, Scannable or OfficeLens. *Do not plan to rely on the phone camera app*. There will be announcement of times to practice the upload procedure during the week before the exam. The [cover sheet](http://therisingsea.org/notes/mast30026/exam-2020-coversheet.pdf) is now available.

In addition to these "exercise style" questions, there will be at least one **proof** from the lectures that you will be asked to give in the exam. The following results are explicitly **excluded**:

* Theorem on p.8 of L5 (*Lorentz group*)
* Theorem L8-2 (*Bolzano-Weierstrass*)
* Theorem L9-2 (*sequentially compact iff. compact*)
* Theorem L11-4 (*finite CW-complexes are compact Hausdorff*)
* Theorem L12-4 (*adjunction property*)
* Theorem L12-7 (*compact-open topology vs. closed graphs*)
* Exercise L14-2 (*Bellman equation*)
* Theorem L15-1 (*Picard's theorem*)
* Theorem L16-0 (*Weierstrass approximation*)
* Lemma L16-0.5 (*Bernstein polynomials*)
* Theorem L16-3 (*Stone-Weierstrass*)
* Theorem L18-1 (*L^p-norm and Holder inequality*)
* Lemma L19-1 (*characterisation of finite dimension*)
* Lemma L20-11 (*conspiracy avoidance*)

For the exam you may also ignore Exercise L12-7, Lemma L12-6, L12-8.

And in the tutorials:

* **Tutorial 3**: Lipschitz equivalence
* **Tutorial 4**: Topological abelian groups
* **Tutorial 5**: Real numbers as Cauchy sequences

The later tutorials were primarily extracts from lectures. I have written up some [brief notes](https://gist.github.com/dmurfet/a5e1d06cfa558db85cecb7e655976d19) about my experience with video recording these lectures.
